# International filing plan

This skill gives the method for turning "we want protection in these countries" into a filing plan. The IPRwise connector supplies treaty memberships and country rules with their sources; this skill says how to combine them.

## If the connector is not connected

If the IPRwise tools (`filing_routes`, `country_ip_facts`, `nice_2027_check`, `ip_news`) are not available, ask the user to connect the IPRwise connector: the plugin's **Connectors** tab, **Connect**, then sign in with an IPRwise account (a free account is enough). Without it, mark every membership and rule in the plan as unverified.

## Workflow

1. **Collect the facts.** The right; the first filing (country, date, number) or the home registration; the target countries; for trademarks the classes and specification; the business timeline; budget limits. Ask only for what is missing.
2. **Routes in one call.** Call `filing_routes` once with all target countries and the home country. Build a table: country, Paris, Madrid / Hague / PCT, regional option, note. A Madrid or Hague filing also needs the applicant to be connected to a member: a national of, domiciled in, or with an establishment in a contracting party (often the home country).
3. **Priority.** From the first filing date, calculate the Paris Convention priority deadline (Art. 4C): 12 months for patents and utility models, 6 months for trademarks and industrial designs. Show the calculation. If the deadline has passed, say so: later filings stand on their own dates.
4. **Choose the route for each country and give the reason.**
   - Trademarks: Madrid where both the applicant's office and the target are members; a national filing where the target is not a Madrid member or needs a local strategy; one EU trade mark for all 27 EU states; OAPI as the only route for its member states. Under Madrid the international registration depends on the basic mark for five years (Madrid Protocol Art. 6(3)): mention this when the basic mark is still exposed to refusal or opposition.
   - Patents: PCT to keep many countries open and defer costs; the EPO for Europe, including extension and validation states; EAPO for its member states; ARIPO (Harare Protocol) for its members. National phase deadlines differ by office: confirm each one.
   - Designs: Hague where the target is a member; otherwise a national or regional filing (EU design, OAPI).
5. **Country rules.** Call `country_ip_facts` for each target country. Flag early: a required local agent, power of attorney formalities (legalisation can take weeks), the filing language and translations, opposition periods.
6. **Classification.** For trademark specifications filed on or after 1 January 2027, run the terms through `nice_2027_check` and propose the new wording where a term was reworded, deleted or moved.
7. **Recent changes.** Call `ip_news` for the main target offices and WIPO. Mention items that affect the plan, such as fee changes or treaty accessions, with their effective dates.
8. **Deliver the plan.** A table with country, route, priority deadline, local agent needed, power of attorney formality, key note and source links; then a dated timeline and next steps. To instruct local attorneys, use the foreign-associate skill and `find_attorneys`.

## Rules

- Do not quote fees: the tools do not return them. Ask the local attorneys for estimates.
- Every country rule in the plan cites the source link `country_ip_facts` returned. No rule from memory.
- Membership dates matter: a country whose accession is "not yet in force" cannot be designated before that date.
- This is reference information, not legal advice; the user confirms the plan with counsel before filing.
